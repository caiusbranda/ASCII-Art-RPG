/////// Movement ///////
1. user inputs direction to move
2. move calls board’s move with string direction
3. board’s move calls move on character with dir
4. char’s move calls move with dir
	a) char calls canMove needs to check just tile in direction


/////// Enemy/Item “death” ///////
1. sets posn of enemy or item to -1,-1
2. notifies board as usual.
3. board runs from 0 to h/w so doesn’t show
4. overlapping is ok because no more functions will be called on “dead” objects

/////// Tiles and Observers //////
1. All entities attach 8 adjacent tiles and it’s current tile to observers on construction
2. On successful movement, pop_back last 9 observers (can guarantee they are tiles) and reattach new 9 tiles after movement

/////// Move stuff //////
need display to replace old tile with previous char
subject has lastPos and curPos
